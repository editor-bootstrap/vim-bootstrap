# Contribution Guidelines

## Introduction

This document explains how to contribute changes to the Vim Bootstrap project.

## Bug reports

Please search for issues on the issue tracker with a variety of keywords to ensure your bug is not already reported.

If unique, [open an issue](https://github.com/avelino/vim-bootstrap/issues/new) and answer the questions so we can understand and reproduce the problematic behavior.

To show us that the issue you are having is in Vim Bootstrap itself, please write clear, concise instructions so we can reproduce the behavior (even if it seems obvious). The more detailed and specific you are, the faster we can fix the issue. Check out [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

Please be kind, remember that Vim-Bootstrap comes at no cost to you, and you're getting free help.

## Discuss your design

The project welcomes submissions but please let everyone know what you're working on if you want to change or add something to the Vim Bootstrap repository.

Before starting to write something new for the Vim Bootstrap project, please [file an issue](https://github.com/avelino/vim-bootstrap/issues/new).

This process gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits inside the goals for the project and tools. It also checks that the design is sound before code is written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level discussions.

## Code review

Changes to Vim Bootstrap must be reviewed before they are accepted, no matter who makes the change even if it is an owner or a maintainer.

Please try to make your pull request easy to review for us. Please read the "[How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/faster_reviews.md)" guide, it has lots of useful tips for any project you may want to contribute. Some of the key points:

* Make small pull requests. The smaller, the faster to review and the more likely it will be merged soon.
* Don't make changes unrelated to your PR. Maybe there are typos on some comments, maybe refactoring would be welcome on a function... but if that is not related to your PR, please make *another* PR for that.
* Split big pull requests into multiple small ones. An incremental change will be faster to review than a huge PR.

## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have [team maintainers](../MAINTAINERS). Every PR **MUST** be reviewed by at least two maintainers (or owners) before it can get merged. A maintainer should be a contributor of Vim Boostrap and contributed at least 4 accepted PRs. A contributor should apply as a maintainer in the [Gitter develop channel](https://gitter.im/avelino/vim-bootstrap). The owners or the team maintainers may invite the contributor. A maintainer should spend some time on code reviews. If a maintainer has no time to do that, they should apply to leave the maintainers team and we will give them the honor of being a member of the **advisors team**. Of course, if an advisor has time to code review, we will gladly welcome them back to the maintainers team. If a maintainer is inactive for more than 3 months and forgets to leave the maintainers team, the owners may move him or her from the maintainers team to the advisors team.

## Owners

Vim Bootstrap in mantained by community and to keep the development healthy we will elect three owners every year. All contributors may vote to elect up to three candidates, one of which will be the main owner, and the other two the assistant owners. When the new owners have been elected, the old owners will give up ownership to the newly elected owners. If an owner is unable to do so, the other owners will assist in ceding ownership to the newly elected owners.

After the election, the new owners should proactively agree with our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) requirements on the [Gitter main channel](https://gitter.im/avelino/vim-bootstrap). Below are the words to speak:

```
I'm honored to having been elected an owner of Vim Bootstrap, I agree with [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md). I will spend part of my time on Vim Bootstrap and lead the development of Vim Bootstrap.
```
