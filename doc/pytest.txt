*pytest.txt*   Runs py.test within vim and displays a red or green bar as 
results with some details when it fails.

Simple approach to visual selection of Python blocks.

1. Intro                                                          *PytestIntro*

Talking with Holger Krekel (original author of py.test and vim user) we thought
it would be neat to be able to call it from vim and get some immediate results.

This is especially useful when you are tweaking and do not want to be moving
around between the terminal and your vim session.

2. Usage                                                          *PytestUsage*

This plugin provides a single command::

    Pytest

All arguments are able to be tab-completed.

For running tests the plugin provides 3 arguments with an optional one. 
These arguments are::

    class
    method
    file


As you may expect, those will focus on the tests for the current class, method
or the whole file.

If you are in a class and want to run all the tests for that class, you would
call this plugin like::

    :Pytest class

Whenever a command is triggered a small message displays informing you that
the plugin is running a certain action. In the above call, you would see 
something like this::

    Running tests for class TestMyClass

If you would like to see the complete py.test output you can add an optional "verbose"
flag to any of the commands for Pytest. For the previous command, it would
look like::

    :Pytest class verbose

This would open a split scratch buffer that you can fully interact with. You
can close this buffer with ':wq' or you can hit 'q' at any moment in that buffer
to close it.

When tests are successful a green bar appears. If you have any number of fails
you get a red bar with a line-by-line list of line numbers and errors.

I strongly encourage a mapping for the above actions. For example, if you
wanted leader mappings you would probably do them like this::

    " Pytest
    nmap <silent><Leader>f <Esc>:Pytest file<CR>
    nmap <silent><Leader>c <Esc>:Pytest class<CR>
    nmap <silent><Leader>m <Esc>:Pytest method<CR>


This plugin also provides a way to jump to the actual error. Since errors can
be living in a file other than your test (e.g. a syntax error in your source
that triggers an assertion errro in the current file) you can also jump to that
file. The list of jumping-to-error arguments are::

    first
    last
    next 
    previous
    end


Pytest **DOES NOT JUMP AUTOMATICALLY** to errors. You have to call the action. When
you call a jump, a split buffer is opened with a file (if it is not the same as
the one you are currently editing) and places you in the same line number were
the error was reported.

If an error starts in the current file but ends on a different one, you can
call that ``end of error`` by calling ``:Pytest end``.

Finally, you can also display in a split scratch buffer either the last list
of failed tests (with line numbers, errors and paths) or the last ``py.test``
session (similar to what you would see in a terminal). The arguments that 
you would need to provide for such actions are::

    session
    fails

``session`` is the buffer with a similar output to the terminal (but with
syntax highlighting) and ``fails`` has the list of last failed errors.

The reason behind this is that as soon as you hit any key, the quick display
goes away. With a split buffer you are in control and you can quit that window
when you decide -  while you work on fixing errors.

The commands that open the last session and the last fails are toggable: they
will close the scratch buffer if it is open or will open it if its closed.

Thanks to Holger Krekel for the awesome py.test tool as it makes my life so
much better.

Some small parts of this code uses Gary Bernhardt's vimrc functions and a lot
more code is being re-used from chapa.vim - a plugin that allows easy movements
in Python files.
